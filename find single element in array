Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
Example 1:
Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
 
Example 2:
Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output:4

SOLUTION:

def Single(arr,n):
    result = arr[0]
    for i in range(1,n):
        result = result ^ arr[i]
    return result
    

arr = [];
n = int(input("Enter number of elements :")) 
for i in range(0, n): 
    ele = int(input()) 
    arr.append(ele)

print(single(arr,len(arr))
